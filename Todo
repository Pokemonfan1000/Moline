## Thing to add 

## Version 1.1

Award system: You get an award displayed on your profile when you acheive something such as for making 500 and 1000 
posts respectively and for being a former moderator. You also get an award for being here for a certain amount of years (5 and 10)
plus other stuff not mentioned here. Inspired by the Braingle award system

A new power level that ties in with the Karma feature (It will be automated so I won't have to approve the status) This is inspired by the 
trusted member powerlevel found on vizzed.

An Item shop.

Currency for said Item shop.

Abillity to send currency to other users (such as to me for the future rent-a-forum feature which is inspired by the one found at 
vizzed board)

A veteran powerlevel. Former moderators will get this (along with an award) and people who have over 250 posts and have the 
trusted powerlevel (and are really well known) and have been here for a year. It'll be rare for anyone but former staff to get this.

A Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentines, St. Patricks, Easter, Memorial day/4th of july/labor day holiday themes
